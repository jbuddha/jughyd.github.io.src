    Not sure what all this is about?, then this is exactly the page may you want to go through. Read away.

    Java User Groups(JUGs) are Java Enthusiasts that come together to contribute, learn, work together for the progress 
    of Open Source Community around the world. There are many JUGs, primarily formed based on geographic proximity. 
    We have formed a group named Java User Group Hyderabad and have been contributing to Open Source.
    If you want to be a part of it, come join your hands in coding Future Java.
